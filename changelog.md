| Version       | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3.9.1         | Refactored the way reference pointers are passed around and added options pattern to main function without braking backwards compatibility! You can now add a base path, change the reference strategy (or opt out), and still set the schema name inside the options object or outside as before.      |
| 3.9.0         | Added support for multipleOf number validaion, .rest() schemas for tuples and key validation for records (only compatible with string keys due to JSON Schema limitation).                                                                                                                              |
| 3.7.x - 3.8.x | Skipped to reach functional parity with Zod versioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.6.1         | Realised intersection had another potential ref pathing bug. Fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.6.0         | Added support for default & effects (refine). Broke out changelog.md                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3.5.0         | Added support for CUID string validation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3.4.3         | Fixed $ref pathing for catchall and intersection. Additional tests and code structure fixes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3.4.2         | Fixed broken intersection parser (Thanks [Noah2610](https://github.com/Noah2610)!)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3.4.1         | Fixed pathing bug for nullable items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3.4.0         | Added support for z.lazy()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3.3.0         | Added support for catchall (additionalProperties schema on objects). Rebuilt object parser.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.2.0         | Added support for Map and Set as seen by their most common JSON definitions. Beware no standardized definition seem to exist and JSON.parse doesn't handle either natively. Their implementations here are based on the spread approach. Also further simplified intersection definition to just allOf. |
| 3.1.0         | String patterns finally supported! Fixed bugs include broken external type, unsafe nullable parsing, bad intersection implementation, and missing support for passthrough keys in objects.                                                                                                              |
| 3.0.3         | Fixed array deep pathing bug (path contained `array` instead of `items`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3.0.2         | Fixed broken type usage (NonEmptyArrayDefinition was removed from Zod)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 3.0.0         | Compatible with Zod 3.2.0. Huge props to [Mr Hammad Asif](https://github.com/mrhammadasif) for his work on this.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 0.6.2         | Hotfix for undefined object properties. Could crash the parser when using Pick                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 0.6.1         | Fixed bug in union pathing. `$Ref` was missing `/anyOf`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 0.6.0         | Moved `@types/json-schema` and `typescript` to dev dependencies. `@types/json-schema` is now only used for the test suites. Using `strict: true` in ts config.                                                                                                                                          |
| 0.5.1         | First working release with all relevant Zod types present with most validations (except for string patterns due to Zod not exposing the source regexp pattern for those).                                                                                                                               |
| < 0.5.1       | Deprecated due to broken package structure. Please be patient, I eat crayons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
